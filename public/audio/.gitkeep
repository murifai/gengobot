# Audio Files Directory

This directory stores temporary audio files for voice chat responses.

Audio files are automatically generated during task-based voice conversations and are served to the client for playback.

## Cleanup

Audio files should be periodically cleaned up to prevent disk space issues. Consider implementing:
- Automatic cleanup after conversation completion
- Scheduled cleanup of files older than 24 hours
- Size-based cleanup if directory exceeds certain size
